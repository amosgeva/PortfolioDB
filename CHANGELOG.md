# Changelog

This file records anything that changes **how a number is computed**, how data is
stored, or what an upgrade requires — because the README tells you to upgrade with
`docker compose pull`, and you are entitled to know what that changes before you
run it against your own records.

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versions follow [semver](https://semver.org/): a major bump means a migration or
a computation change you should read before applying.

## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-08-13

First public release. Everything below already existed; this is the starting
point rather than a list of changes.

### The ledger

- Append-only lot table: every BUY and SELL is a row, and open quantity, cost
  basis and realized P&L are **recomputed from those rows on every read**. No
  derived number is ever persisted, so no number can quietly drift from the
  trades that produced it.
- FIFO and moving-average engines run side by side over the same lots, scoped per
  `(symbol, account)`. BUY fees inflate cost basis; SELL fees reduce proceeds.
- Splits are applied at read time from `corporate_actions`, so an adjustment is
  undone by deleting a row.
- Money is `Decimal` end to end inside the engines; conversion to `float` happens
  only for display.

### Running it

- One published multi-arch image (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) — pulled, not
  built. No Python or toolchain on your machine.
- Dashboard, scheduler and an optional read-only MCP server all run from that one
  image; `make init && make up && make schema` is the whole install.
- Price collection obeys a single configured market window, editable from
  Manage → Settings rather than in `.env`.
- Backups are a `pg_dump` (`make backup`); restore refuses to run into a
  non-empty database.

### The optional parts

- **Advisor** — brief and chat against Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter or a fully
  local model through Ollama. It reads an investor one-pager you write yourself,
  pasted into the dashboard and stored in the database.
- **MCP server** — 47 tools, 7 resources and 7 prompts over the same engines the
  dashboard uses. Read-only: the pool forces `default_transaction_read_only`, and
  a SELECT-only role is available via `make ro-role`.

### Known limitations, stated plainly

Single currency (mixed currencies are **wrong, not approximate**), equities and
ETFs only, no broker sync, no authentication, no shorts, one person's portfolio.
See "Scope and limitations" in the README before installing.
